Mirror method
1. check whether the left side and right side sub-trees are equal
2. use the root twice (obviously very clear and necessary)
3. if both tree are null then the two trees (subtrees in recursion) are same
4. if one of the node is null then, they are not same (root and root is same)
5. check the whether two values are equal and use the rectursion twice for checking two nodes cross left and right.
