###  Fun Math
​
So basically we want to know which bulb will be operated at odd times. It's a simple factors count, which is not too complicated, for example:
​
```
1: 1
2: 1,2
3: 1,3
4: 1,4,2
5: 1,5
```
As a result, only perfect squares can have the odd factors. And the property of sqrt(n) indicates there are int(sqrt(n)) numbers there.
