# Intuition
The intuition behind this code is to find the level in a binary tree that has the maximum sum of node values.

# Approach
The code uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the binary tree level by level. It starts with a queue containing the root node and an empty list to store the nodes at the current level. It also initializes variables for the maximum sum found so far (maxi), the current level (count), and the level with the maximum sum (res).

The code then enters a loop where it processes each level of the tree. Within the loop, it dequeues nodes from the queue and appends their children to the level list. This effectively moves to the next level in the tree.

After processing all nodes in the current level, the code updates the queue with the nodes in the level list and checks if the queue is empty. If it's not empty, it means there are more levels to process, so the code increments the count and calculates the sum of node values in the current level. If the sum is greater than the previous maximum sum (maxi), it updates maxi and res with the new values.

The level list is reset to an empty list to prepare for the next level.

Finally, if the queue becomes empty, it means all levels have been processed, and the code returns the level with the maximum sum (res).

# Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because every node in the tree is processed exactly once by the BFS algorithm. Each node is dequeued, its value is used in summing operations, and its children (if any) are enqueued.

Space complexity:
The space complexity of the code is O(n) as well. In the worst-case scenario, the queue will need to store all nodes in a level of the binary tree. This happens when the tree is a complete binary tree and we're dealing with the last level, which contains roughly n/2 nodes. As big O notation considers the upper bound, we can say the space complexity is O(n).â€‹
